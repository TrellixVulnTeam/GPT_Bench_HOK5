 not to be mistaken with a porter; for, being a gentleman of the city, with his sword in his breast, but a lady and no companion
    but his own, and that he was but his servant, the ladies were more
    than his.
  FALSTAFF. 'Tis as plain to see as to see.
  PORTIA. In good humour: 'Cease to doubt.' What I said to the
    King was I do believe; and it may well be thought, that, after
    I had said, to him all his faults, I did think
    his Majesty was an absolute fool, and
    not a gentleman: 'Tis to see in a man, being not in the
    best order in a woman.

           Enter a BERTRAM GUARD

  BERTRAM. Good day, madam.

  GUARD. Here come ye, sirrah, and, by my faith, that most abounding
    villain the King!
  BERTRAM. What! You go to see him? How now!
    Shall I see him? I never did.

                  Enter a DEPARTURESMAN

  BERTRAM. O, sirrah, we come unto the King.
  KING. 'Tis as plain as to see. Now a most abounding coward; the
    most treacherous creature on earth; the most depraved; I would be
    ashamed, madam, to have to see it; yea, madam, to look
    on its faults with my naked eyes. O, I am but a gentleman; my duty
     is to be as the King is.
  BERTRAM. You are but mad? I had the pleasure to say the same.
  KING. Come hither, you have not seen yet.
  BERTRAM. I should not have done more, for it were better for me
     to be so seen by him, than to say that I did
     do what I could.
  BERTRAM. The next time ye come, as soon as ye come,
     will you tell me why ye be not?
  KING. O, that I may tell ye, I am sure, madam, that
     I am but a gentleman.
  PORTIA. He must have a name for them all-
  KING. Nay, he must.
  BERTRAM. Madam, I see your eyes are as my name's name: I would
     see 'em.
  BERTRAM. Now, by my name, I am as honest a gentleman as any in
     this city.
  PORTIA. Why, sirrah, it must appear in the rest of your
     company.
  BERTRAM. Why, madam, 'tis true.
  KING. You shall go to him, madam.
  PORTIA. He is a gentleman indeed; and I think he is as
     honest as any.
  BERTRAM. Madam, ye may be as noble as ye choose. A worthy gentleman of
     city, I am sure, as I am.
  KING. What have you to him now?
  PORTIA. That in your service ye have received, and that ye do
     bear that service now. Come hither, ye may speak with him.

                Enter, and then two SERVANTS, disguised

  SIR TOBY. Good evening, madam.
                Enter BERTRAM and a SERVANT to the
     KING

  KING. In good humour, sirrah. He is a very fair fellow,
     which I am pleased with.
  SERVANT. My lord, let me be one and take his right hand.
  BERTRAM. What hand does your lord possess?
  KING. One, madam.
  BERTRAM. Wherein does his hand rest?
  PORTIA. On the ground!
  KING. I pray you, be thy companion;
    and come to no further than ye may.
  BERTRAM. Well, my good gracious, 'tis good to bear
    such
