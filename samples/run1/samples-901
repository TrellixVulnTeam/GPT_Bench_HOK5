 Cup:
  King. He will not marry this lady: 'Twill vex me
     To have her as a woman; and all that I could
     Do was to take her off at my pleasure. Now let me see,
     That what ever it should have wished I did, the King,
     Is the more sadder man.
  King. He'll leave her at once,
     I hear it say.
  Duke. I fear so;
  King. Do you hear't?
  Duke. All-a-day
  King. And I hope he will.
  Duke. Then leave't so; 'twere most to do. If he'll be
     A bride for a lady, my lord, be it not so.
     I am sad and afraid to-morrow will I never come
     To see the King at all again. He is now
     My greatest vexation, and I hope I'll never be
     One to call.
  Duke. I prithee stand forth.
  King. Let me see, and I'll be glad it is true.  'Twas
     The goodly Prince that left you, and I know not
     Whether he be sad. Well, he is sad. Farewell,
     I know not where to say 'A.' He hath got the king,
     If I know it not. 'A' thou say'st.
  Duke. It is a great deal to say 'A.'
  King. It should be.
  Duke. O heaven!
  King. 'A' thou say'st, a great deal to say 'A,' a great deal to say 'a', yet
     There is no man to say 'a' and speak so sweet.
  Duke. I hope 'A' is so.
  King. 'A' I say 'a'; but 'a' I say 'A'! Ah 'a!
